# Telegram Chat Bot

Telegram Chat Bot is an open source project that allows users to chat with an AI-powered chatbot in their Telegram app. This repository contains a Python script that uses the ChatGPT API to generate intelligent responses to user queries.

## Getting Started

To use the Telegram Chat Bot, there are two options:

1. **Run locally:** Clone this repository to your local machine, install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file included in the repository. Edit the `.env` file with your bot token and ChatGPT API key. Then, run the `main.py` script to start the bot.

2. **Use Docker:** With Docker installed, simply clone this repository and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file included in the repository. Edit the `.env` file with your bot token and ChatGPT API key before doing this. Then run `docker-compose up` to start the bot in a Docker container.

Once you've completed one of these options, you can now chat with the bot in your Telegram app.
