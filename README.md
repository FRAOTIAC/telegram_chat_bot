# Telegram ChatGPT Bot

Telegram ChatGPT Bot is an open source project that allows users to chat with an AI-powered chatbot in their Telegram app. This repository contains a Python script that uses the ChatGPT API to generate intelligent responses to user queries.
Inspiration comes from these two repositories: n3d1117/chatgpt-telegram-bot and karfly/chatgpt_telegram_bot.

## Features
1. Automatically Forget Earliest Messages When Message Length Exceeds Limit
With this feature, if a message exceeds a certain length limit, the system will automatically forget the earliest messages to make room for new messages. This can help prevent the system from becoming overloaded with too much data, which can affect its performance.

2. Adding Multiple Modes, Including Assistant and DAN modes
This feature allows users to switch between different modes depending on their needs. For example, an "assistant" mode could be designed to provide helpful suggestions and guidance, while various "dan" modes could be tailored to different conversation styles and personalities. By offering multiple modes, the system can provide a more personalized and engaging experience for users.


## Getting Started

To use the Telegram ChatGPT Bot, there are two options:

1. **Run locally:** Clone this repository to your local machine, install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file included in the repository. Edit the `.env` file with your bot token and ChatGPT API key. Then, run the `main.py` script to start the bot.

2. **Use Docker:** With Docker installed, simply clone this repository and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file included in the repository. Edit the `.env` file with your bot token and ChatGPT API key before doing this. Then run `docker-compose up` to start the bot in a Docker container.

Once you've completed one of these options, you can now chat with the bot in your Telegram app.
